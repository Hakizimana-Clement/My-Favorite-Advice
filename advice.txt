10 pieces of advice to every person.

1. When respect is no longer there, find your way out. 
Although it is hard to start over, do not wait until you lose yourself in the process.

2. Do not chase love. Chase your dreams instead.

3. No one has the right to make you feel worthless. You are more than enough.

4. If someone really loves you, they will pursue you and will make real efforts.

5. Please know that you are beautiful together with your scars and imperfections.

6. You do not need to compare yourself to anyone. You have a different journey to take.

7. Your only competition is yourself. Hone your skills and be a better version of you.

8. If it fails, it is not love in the first place. True love bends but it never breaks.

9. Working hard is good but you have to prioritize your health. Find time to be with your family. They are the ones who will be there for you in your darkest days.

10. Prioritize yourself. Love yourself. It has long been overdue.
